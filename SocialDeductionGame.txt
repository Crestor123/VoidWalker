Win State:
	Killer - Get away with the crime
	All Other Players - Discover who the killer is

Game Flow:
	5-10 minutes for all players to walk around location
		All objects can be picked up and moved to different containers, and keep track of fingerprints/bloodstains and its position
		Any objects that can be used as weapons are tagged as such
		(Each player has a "secret" to keep?)
		The killer uses this time to plan
		The other players must investigate and familiarize themselves with the layout
	The killer can pause time for 3 minutes to carry out the plan
		The other players cannot see anything that the killer does within this time
	10-15 minutes for all players to gather evidence
		Nothing can be moved during this time, and fingerprints cannot be added to objects
		Each player collects evidence into a personal log, which includes all known information about the object
	Indefinite time to argue
		The players compare their findings in an attempt to discover the killer
		This phase ends when all players have voted on the killer's identity, or, if no consensus can be reached, to continue the investigation
			If the investigation continues, the players have 5 more minutes to find evidence
				The killer is now able to tamper with the crime scene, though any previously collected evidence is not altered
	If the players discover the identity of the killer, they win
	Otherwise, the killer wins
